# MegaLoot-Imitation-Datapack
Datapack for Minecraft JE 1.14, that tries to imitate Megaloot mod

This datapack for Minecraft Java Edition tries to imitate the Megaloot mod, that was created by Zairus.
(link to his awesome project: https://github.com/Zairus/MegaLoot)
I'm not affiliated with the Megaloot mod in any way. (!)

 ## Note: this is still WIP

It is my first datapack, so there may be better ways to do the stuff that I'm doing :-P.

Big thanks to MCStacker, the awesome command generator - https://mcstacker.net

Since I don't have the perms to use the textures of megaloot mod, you'll have to
download them yourself.
