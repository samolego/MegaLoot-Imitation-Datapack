# MegaLoot-Imitation-Datapack
Datapack for Minecraft JE 1.14, that tries to imitate Megaloot mod

I'm not affiliated with the megaloot mod in any way. (!)

This datapack for Minecraft Java Edition tries to imitate the megaloot mod, that was created by Zairus.
(link to his awesome project: https://github.com/Zairus/MegaLoot)

It is my first datapack, so there may be better ways to do the stuff that I'm doing :-P.

Since I don't have the perms to use the textures of megaloot mod, you'll have to
bake them up yourself.
